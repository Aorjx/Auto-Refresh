Auto-Refresh for Web Resources

Auto-Refresh for Web Resources
This JavaScript-based solution automatically monitors and refreshes various resources on a webpage (such as CSS, JS, images, videos, iframes, etc.) when they are updated on the server. By periodically checking the "Last-Modified" timestamp of each resource, it ensures that the browser loads the latest versions of these resources without needing a full page reload.

Key Features:
Automatic Resource Monitoring: Automatically tracks changes to HTML, CSS, JS, images, and more.

Efficient Refresh Mechanism: Reloads individual resources (such as scripts and stylesheets) when an update is detected, without reloading the entire page.

Supports Multiple Resource Types: Supports various resource types like <script>, <link>, <img>, <iframe>, and more.

Customizable Check Interval: Configurable check interval to define how often resources are checked for updates.

Uses Last-Modified Header: Fetches the "Last-Modified" timestamp from the server to check if the resource has changed.

Graceful Fallback: Handles situations where the Last-Modified header is missing or the fetch request fails.

This solution can be particularly useful for single-page applications (SPAs) or dynamic websites where resources are updated frequently, but a full page reload is not desired.
