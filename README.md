# Auto-Refresh
Auto-Refresh for Web Resources

This JavaScript-based solution automatically monitors and refreshes various resources on a webpage (such as CSS, JS, images, videos, iframes, etc.) when they are updated on the server. By periodically checking the "Last-Modified" timestamp of each resource, it ensures that the browser loads the latest versions of these resources without requiring a full page reload.

Key Features:
Automatic Resource Monitoring: Automatically tracks changes to HTML, CSS, JS, images, and more.

Efficient Refresh Mechanism: Reloads individual resources (such as scripts and stylesheets) when an update is detected, without reloading the entire page.

Supports Multiple Resource Types: Supports various resource types like <script>, <link>, <img>, <iframe>, and more.

Customizable Check Interval: Configurable check interval to define how often resources are checked for updates.

Uses Last-Modified Header: Fetches the "Last-Modified" timestamp from the server to check if the resource has changed.

Graceful Fallback: Handles situations where the Last-Modified header is missing or the fetch request fails.

This solution is ideal for developers working on websites or web applications who want to streamline the development process, avoid constant manual page reloads (e.g., F5), and ensure that changes to resources like CSS and JavaScript are instantly reflected without interrupting their workflow.
